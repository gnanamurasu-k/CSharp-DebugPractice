# C# Debug Practice – by Gnanamurasu 🛠️

This repository is for practicing **program correction and debugging in C#**.

Each file shows:
- A **small C# program**
- With **correct logic**
- And comments explaining **common mistakes** that beginners make.

I am using this to build my **problem-solving and debugging skills** for future jobs and internships.

## Example Topics Covered

- Input and output mistakes  
- Integer vs double issues  
- If-else logic errors  
- Loop mistakes  
- Array index errors  

More examples will be added in future as I learn.

## Technologies

- Language: **C#**
- Type: **Console Applications**
- Tool: Visual Studio / .NET SDK (later for running locally)

For now, this repository is mainly to **show code and corrections** properly.
